ospd 1.0+beta1 (2014-08-30)

This is the first public release of the ospd module for the Open
Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS).

The ospd module consists of the ospd base class and in this version
includes wrappers for these scanners (wrapper version):
ovaldi (1.0+beta1, including remote control) and w3af (1.0+beta1).
The actual scanners are not included and need to be installed separately.

The scanners are wrapped with the OpenVAS Scanner Protocol (OSP) version
0.1.0 for unified usage via OSP clients. The wrapped scanners can be executed
via command line or fully integrated with web interface via OpenVAS Manager.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release:
Hani Benhabiles and Jan-Oliver Wagner.
