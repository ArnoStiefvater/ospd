INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR OSPD
==================================

Please note: The reference system used by most of the developers is Debian
Debian GNU/Linux 'Wheezy' 7. The build might fail on any other systems.
Also it is necessary to install dependent development packages.


Prerequisites for OSPD
----------------------

Prerequisites:
* python
* python-pexpect: For running/interacting with w3af_console and remote-ovaldi.sh


Building OSPD
-------------

To install OSPD into directory <prefix> run this command:

python setup.py install --prefix=<prefix> --install-scripts=<prefix>/bin

The default for <prefix> is /usr/local

You may need to set the PYTHONPATH like this before running
the install command (perhaps with another python version):

export PYTHONPATH=<prefix>/lib/python2.7/site-packages/


Creating a source archive
-------------------------

To create a .tar.gz file for the ospd module run this command:

python setup.py sdist

This will crwate the archive file in the subdirectory "dist".
