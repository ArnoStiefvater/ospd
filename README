About OSPD
----------

OSPD is a base class for scanner wrappers which share the same communication
protocol: OSP (OpenVAS Scanner Protocol). OSP creates a unified interface for
different security scanners and make their control flow and scan results
consistently under the central OpenVAS Manager service.

OSP is similar in many ways to OMP (OpenVAS Management Protocol): XML-based,
stateless and non-permanent connection.

The design supports wrapping further scanners with same protocol OSP,
sharing the core daemon options while adding scanner specific parameters and
options.
